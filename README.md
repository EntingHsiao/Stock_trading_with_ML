# Stock_trading_with_ML
Compare the performance of 3 portfolios:  hand-crafted strategy portfolio, benchmark portfolio and ML portfolio 


In this project, I compared three stock portfolios below:
Manual Strategy portfolio: I implemented a set of hand crafted rules using 3 technical indicators, Simple Moving Average(SMA), moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and stochastic oscillator, to determine a buy/sell signal.
Strategy Learner portfolio: I developed a random forest learner that can learn a trading policy using the same technical indicators above.
Benchmark portfolio : The performance of a portfolio starting with $100,000 cash, investing in 1000 shares of the symbol "JPM" in use on the first trading day, and holding that position. Include transaction costs.
